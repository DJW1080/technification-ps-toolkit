# Technification PowerShell Toolkit

**technification-ps-toolkit** is the root repository for all PowerShell scripts developed under the *Technification* banner.  
It is built on three principles: **safety, usability, and transparency**.

---

## 🔧 What’s Inside
- **Registry Cleaner (Hybrid + Full)** – safe removal of obsolete keys with backups and logs.
- **Registry Scanner** – detect invalid or suspicious entries.
- **Backup & Restore Utilities** – export/import registry hives with versioned backups.
- **Audit Trail Viewer** – parse and review logs for full accountability.

---

## 🛡️ Philosophy
Every script in this toolkit is designed with:
- **Transparency** – every action is echoed and logged.
- **Safety** – backups before deletion, reversible processes.
- **Auditability** – timestamped logs for traceability.
- **User Control** – prompts and modular design for customization.
